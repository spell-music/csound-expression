{- |
Gets the level of a send to a buss.

Gets the level at which signals from the send are being added to the buss. The actual sending of the signal to the buss
is performed by the MixerSend opcode.

Receives an arate signal from a channel of a buss.

Receives an arate signal that has been mixed onto a channel of a buss.

{- |
Sets the level of a send to a buss.

Sets the level at which signals from the send are added to the buss. The actual sending of the signal to the buss
is performed by the MixerSend opcode.

{- |
Sets the level of a send to a buss.

Sets the level at which signals from the send are added to the buss. This opcode, because all parameters are irate, may
      be used in the orchestra header. The actual sending of the signal to the buss
      is performed by the MixerSend opcode.
