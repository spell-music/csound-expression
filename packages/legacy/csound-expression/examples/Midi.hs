module Main where

-- imports everything
import Csound.Base

-- Let's define a simple sound unit that
-- reads in cycles the table that contains a single sine partial.
-- oscil1 is the standard oscillator with linear interpolation.
-- 1 - means the amplitude, cps - is cycles per second and the last argument
-- is the table that we want to read.
myOsc :: Sig -> Sig
myOsc cps = oscili 1 cps (sines [1])

-- Let's define a simple instrument that plays a sound on the specified frequency.
-- We use @sig@ to convert a constant value to signal and then plug it in the osc unit.
-- We make it a bit quieter by multiplying with 0.5.
pureTone :: (D, D) -> Sig
pureTone (amp, cps) = 0.4 * sig amp * fades 0.2 1.5 * (myOsc $ sig cps)

-- Renders generated csd-file to the "tmp.csd" and runs it with flags
-- for real time output and listening for the midi events from all devices.
main :: IO ()
main = vdac $ midi $ onMsg pureTone

-- If we have a real midi device
-- we can try with hardware midi:

-- main = dac $ midi $ onMsg pureTone
