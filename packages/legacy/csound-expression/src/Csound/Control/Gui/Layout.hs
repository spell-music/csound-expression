{- | The functions from this module specify the geometry
of the GUI-elements. They tell where to render the elements.

Every element is rectangular. To know where to place the element is
to know the parameters of the bounding rectangle. All rectangles are
relative and automatically aligned.

We have two functions for grouping. They construct horizontal and vertical
groups of the elements. Within the group we can change the relative size
of the rectangles (by scaling one side of the rectangle). In place of rectangle
we can put an empty space.
